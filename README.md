This is my final project for Database Management Systems Fall 2020. 

## Structure

This project utilizes a **server.js** file for organizing requests, several ejs render files to show the UI of the database queries. We use MSSQL for our database framework.
All of the database queries performed are stored procedures with the permissions for the webuser for securities sake. 

## The Challenges

The most cerebrally complex part of this project was certainly using the associative entity to work with getting all movies of a certain genre and all genres of a certain movie. As far as code goes, the most complex part was constructing all of the data in an appealing way using css and ejs.
